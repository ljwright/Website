abstract: "Several studies show that youth unemployment is associated with worse mental health later in life (so called “scarring effects”). Little research has looked at whether scarring effects differ in size across working life or whether they are modified by economic conditions at the time of entering the labour market. Yet such information is important for understanding how scarring effects operate, for identifying vulnerable groups and for locating points at which interventions could be made. I explore these questions using harmonised data from the BHPS and UKHLS. In multilevel linear regressions, I find that that individuals with 6+ months unemployment in the first three years after leaving full time education have worse mental health (as measured by GHQ Likert) than their peers across working life, with the differences growing in size as individuals age. The scarring effect is larger among those who leave full-time education into a tight labour market. This difference becomes more pronounced as individuals age. This work is preliminary and contributes to the first chapter of my PhD thesis."
