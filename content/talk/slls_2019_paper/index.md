abstract: "Several studies find an association between youth worklessness and mental wellbeing in later life. However, few studies have assessed whether this association differs across groups. Such information is important for identifying vulnerable individuals and points at which interventions could be made. Using data from Next Steps, I assess whether the association between 6+ months NEET between ages 18-20 and GHQ Likert scores at age 25 is moderated by gender, family socio-economic class, neighbourhood deprivation, locus of control and preferences for any job over unemployment. I find evidence that associations are stronger amongst males, those from more deprived neighbourhoods, those with less internal locus of control, and those who do not prefer any job to unemployment, though point estimates are imprecise. The results suggest that particular groups may suffer more greatly from periods of worklessness. Future research should move from estimating overall assocations to exploring moderation and mediation in further detail. This work is preliminary and contributes to the second chapter of my PhD thesis."
