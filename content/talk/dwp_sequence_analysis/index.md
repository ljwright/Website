abstract: "In this presentiation, I give a brief overview of Sequence Analysis, a data driven method for grouping similar sequences together (e.g. work-life histories). Sequence Analysis is a popular method in sociology, but has been little applied in the economics literature, though is a promising way for exploring progression and other, longer-term outcomes in the labour market."
