abstract: "Several studies find an association between youth worklessness and mental wellbeing in later life. However, few studies have assessed whether this association difference across groups. Such information is important for identifying vulnerable individuals and points at which interventions could be made. Using data from Next Steps, I assess whether the association between 6+ months NEET between ages 18-20 and GHQ Likert scores at age 25 is moderated by gender, family socio-economic class, neighbourhood deprivation or locus of control. I find evidence that associations are greater amongst males, those from more deprived neighbourhoods, and those with less internal locus of control, though point estimates are imprecise. The results suggest that particular groups may suffer more greatly from periods of youth worklessness. Futurue research should move from estimating overall assocations to exploring moderation and mediation of effects in further detail. This work is preliminary and contributes to the second chapter of my PhD thesis."
