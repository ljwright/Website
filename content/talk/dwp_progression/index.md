abstract: "The majority of low paid jobs in the UK are held by part-time workers and one in eight part-time workers reports wanting to work more hours. Decreasing in-work poverty is a problem of increasing hours as well as hourly wages, but the majority of the literature has focused on the latter question. In this presentation, I report the results of an analysis I carried while at the DWP which explores the labour market experiences people face in the three years after leaving part-time work. Using harmonised data from the BHPS and UKHLS, I find considerable heterogeneity and cycling in the labour market, with only 30% of those leaving part-time work sustaining full-time employment over the next three years. Men are disproportionately likely to sustain full-time employment, with women less likely to do so, even conditional on moving from part-time to full-time work. This analysis uses Sequence Analysis methods, which I argue are preferable to logical rule approaches to categorising labour market trajectories, which have been used elsewhere in the literature."
