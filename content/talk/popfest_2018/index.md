abstract: "Several studies find an association between youth unemployment and mental wellbeing in later life. However, little work has been carried out to explore how this association changes through the life course. Such information is important for understanding the pathways through which such an association might arise. In this presentation, I present the results of an analysis which looks at the association between months unemployment between ages 18-21 and trajectories of mental wellbeing between ages 22-60. I find persistent differences between those with experiences of youth unemployment and those without which grow or dimish through time depending on the unemployment rate faced at ages 18-21. The work is preliminary and contributes to the first chapter of my PhD thesis."
