abstract: "In the presentation, I provide a tutorial on using R Markdown to create reproducible, dynamic documents in R. I also discuss using APIs and web scraping to download data from the internet directly into R, with a focus on the ONS API. Code to produce the slides and an accompanying document are available in the links and from [here](././files/dwp_rmarkdown_report.zip)."
