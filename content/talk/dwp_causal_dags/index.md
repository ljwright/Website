abstract: "Causal Directed Acyclic Diagrams (DAGs) are a clear, simple way of drawing the assumptions of your analysis and provide a clear guide to sources of bias in your model. In this presentation I give a brief introduction to Causal DAGs drawing largely on Miguel Hern√°n's excellent online course *Causal Diagrams: Draw Your Assumptions Before Your Conclusions* ([link](https://www.edx.org/course/causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your-conclusions))"
